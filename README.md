# Simon Say Game

A browser-based implementation of the classic “Simon Says” memory game, built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## 🎮 Project Overview

In this game, the player is shown a sequence of colours (and/or sounds) and must repeat the sequence correctly. With each round the sequence grows by one step, increasing the challenge.  
This version uses a simple and clean UI and is suitable for learning JavaScript, event handling, and basic game logic.

## 🔍 Features

- Colour buttons that light up and make sound (or visual effect) when pressed.  
- Random sequence generation for each new round.  
- Player input detection and validation.  
- Visual feedback for correct vs incorrect input.  
- Score (round) tracking and restart on failure.  
- Responsive layout for use in desktop or mobile browser.
